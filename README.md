The purpose of this report is to understand the variables Life expectancy at Birth and Total Fertility Rate in a specific year by analyzing the frequency distribution of these variables. In addition, the difference of Life Expectancy at Birth between Males and Females is analyzed using a relative frequency distribution of the absolute differences. Complementing that the Pearson correlation coefficient is used to obtain the bivariate correlations of the demographic variables. Using information regarding the geographical location of each country, the subregionsâ€™ Life Expectancy at Birth of Both Sexes and Total Fertility Rate for the year 2020 is compared and the variability of these variables is assessed. The previous analysis is conducted using multi-box plot diagrams and comparing measures of dispersion like total range, interquartile range, and standard deviation. Finally, the change between 2000 and 2020 of Life Expectancy at Birth of Both Sexes and Total Fertility Rate is evaluated with a direct graphical comparison.
